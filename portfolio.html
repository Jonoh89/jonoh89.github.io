  <h1>Portfolio</h1>

  <p>Here is a list of things I have been working on:</p>

  <article class="slots">
    <h2>Slot Games</h2>

    <p>At Bede Gaming, I have worked on making HTML5 canvas slot games. I have worked on different parts of the games from the server game logic to making the reels spin on the client.</p>

    <section class="info">

      <p>
        For the client we use pixi.js, a WebGL renderer with canvas fallback. This means we can share most of our codebase for desktop and mobile games.
        We use a lot of the backbone ecosystem to help modularise parts of the page into separate repositories, deal with preloading images and neatly remove global variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        The client is written in 100% es6 using browserify and babel to transform our many modules into the slot games.
        I have worked on various automation tools using gulp to sprite our images, convert and sprite our sounds and generate our css from sass.
      </p>

      <p>
        The server is a basic node server with the ability to validate bets and play through spins, returning the game state to the client.

  <article class="bingo">
    <h2>Bingo</h2>

    <p>At Bede Gaming, I created a multi-player HTML5 Bingo client. I have worked on the fully modular theme-able client.</p>

      <p>
        For the client we use marionette.js to communicate with a bingo server. The client reacts to bingo server events and allows the user to chat and
        play multi-player bingo games. During my time on this project, I helped to speed our builds up drastically by improving our flow, converting to use browserify and gulp
        rather than AMD and grunt which could not be ran asynchronously.

  <article class="thomson-tmc">
    <h2>Thomson TMC</h2>

    <p>At Penrillian, I worked on Thomsons Travel Money Card application.</p>

      <p>
        The app allows you to check the balance and recent transactions of your Thomson travel money card. Due to working with money, this app was
        highly security tested and worked with secure APIs.
       </p>

      <p>
        This was a native app created in objective-c. It used <a href="http://www.sensiblecocoa.com/">sensible table view</a> for easy mapping
        and generation of tables.

  <article class="web-ui">
    <h2>Vodafone mobile wifi/ mobile dongle device interface</h2>

    <p>At Penrillian, I also worked on Vodafone's mobile internet devices web interface.</p>

    <section class="pictures">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/images/web-ui.png' | prepend: site.baseUrl}}" class="center-block img-responsive"/>
    </section>

    <section class="info">

      <p>
        Throughout the project, Vodafone had two kinds of mobile internet devices: dongles you plug into your computer
        and mobile wifi devices you carry around and connect your various wifi enabled devices. Both of these shared the same user interface
        that we created.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UI had to run on all browsers for users around the world. This could possibly be their first and only access to the internet
        so (unfortunately) this added a requirement that it had to run on any and every browser
        right back to Internet Explorer 6. Due to this, the website was built using basic technologies and techniques, with jQuery being the only
        framework we used.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this project I also worked on an automated testing infrastructure that ran a suite of integration tests on most browsers,
        including all internet explorers. This was written in the language Groovy and used selenium to automate the browser interaction.

    <h2>The Happy Appy</h2>

    <p>At home I created a native iOS app with a friend as a side project.</p>

    <section class="info">

      <p>
        I created a simple app that gives you a quote for whatever negative emotion you are feeling.
        The quotes were stored on parse.com so the users always had the latest quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was created in objective-c using no add-ons.
